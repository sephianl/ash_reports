defmodule AshReports.Application do
  @moduledoc """
  AshReports Application - Supervisor for runtime services.

  This application module provides supervision for runtime services needed by
  AshReports, including chart generation infrastructure.

  ## Services Supervised

  - **Chart Registry**: Tracks active chart instances
  - **Chart Cache**: Caches chart data for performance
  - **Performance Monitor**: Monitors system performance metrics

  ## Data Streaming

  AshReports now uses Ash.stream! natively for data loading with keyset pagination.
  No GenStage infrastructure is needed as Ash Framework handles streaming efficiently.

  ## Usage

  This application is automatically started when AshReports is used. It can also
  be started manually:

      {:ok, pid} = AshReports.Application.start(:normal, [])

  """

  use Application

  alias AshReports.Charts.{Registry, Cache, PerformanceMonitor}

  # Mix is unavailable in a release — capture the env at compile time, not at runtime.
  @compile_env Mix.env()

  @doc """
  Starts the AshReports application supervisor.

  Starts supervision tree with chart infrastructure and other services.

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: AshReports.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
